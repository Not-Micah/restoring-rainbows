export const aboutPageOurStory = `
Both Jordan Chen and Grace Millard had a passion for art and recognized the importance and happiness that comes from making art. They never lacked the supplies or the resources to make art, but quickly realized this wasn't the case for everyone with one-third of households in the U.S. not being able to afford basic school supplies, let alone extras like paint or canvases.
At the same time, Jordan and Grace were struck by the large quantities of plastic markers and other supplies being discarded in schoolsâ€”excess on one side, and necessity on the other. As they did more research they became increasingly alarmed by both the lack of access to educational materials, and the global climate crisis. They noticed an opportunity to close the divide by repurposing unused materials and giving them to those who needed them the most.
Through Restoring Rainbows Jordan and Grace have personally seen the kindness of certain individuals and the meaningful influence of others, motivating them to keep promoting art accessibility and sustainability globally.

Repeatition
- Blogs and SocialMedia + Events and Blogs are very identical components!
- global.css, two animations (very similar) for heroFadeInSlideUp and fadeInSlideUp

Aribtirary
- Blogs and SocialMedia use bg-white to hide the conic-gradient
- Hero has many arbitrary z-indexes!

- page.tsx use of div for y-padding

Suspense Tags
- branches/branch + events/item + partners/partner + stories/item all have excessive Loader component usage..

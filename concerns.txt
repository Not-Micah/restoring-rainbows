Repetition
- global.css, two animations (very similar) for heroFadeInSlideUp and fadeInSlideUp
- SocialMedia.tsx and events/item/page.tsx have identical Swiper code!

Aribitrary
- Blogs and SocialMedia use bg-white to hide the conic-gradient
- Hero has many arbitrary z-indexes!
- NavBar donate button uses arbitrary positioning (overall NavBar code is hard to read!)

Suspense Tags
- branches/branch + events/item + partners/partner + stories/item all have excessive Loader component usage..

Warnings
- Slow scroll + blurry text during text-overflow/scroll in Modal
